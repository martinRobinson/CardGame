# CardGame
A developing System Under Test (SUT) that would be part of a card game and which has accompanying JUnit tests.
The project uses the Gradle build system and has its source and test files organised as per gradle expectations.
Another feature of the project organisation is the presence of the .travis.yml file which configures and organises the Travis continuous integration server.
